This project was developed to support a local small business specializing in hair and makeup services. Recognizing the need for a strong online presence, I collaborated closely with the business owner to create a website that reflects their brand identity and meets the needs of their clientele. The website provides an easy-to-navigate interface, showcasing the range of services offered, client testimonials, and a booking system for appointments. By building this site, I aimed to enhance the business's visibility and accessibility in the community, helping them reach a broader audience and grow their customer base.
